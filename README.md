In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with mySQL. In this app, the user will be able to view items for sale. Using inquirer, the user will be asked what items they would like to purchase. After they enter the id in terminal, another prompt will show up asking how many they would like to purchase.

After the user makes a purchase, a string of text will appear saying "Your Order has been Processed
Thank you for Shopping with us...!"

If the user chooses more items than is in the inventory a message will appear saying "Sorry, we only have ***left."

Thank you for shopping at Bobazon
